# Footnotes

1. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Haskell workshop in Paris, France, on October 1, 2000.

Both papers describe the same type system, but some significant parts of this version have been rewritten, restructured, or expanded to clarify the presentation.

2. Throughout, we use `Haskell' as an abbreviation for `Haskell 98'.

3. The `maps to' symbol +-> is written as +-> in the concrete syntax of Haskell.

4. The symbol :=> (pronounced `then') is written as :=> in the concrete syntax of Haskell, and corresponds directly to the => symbol that is used in instance declarations and in types.

5. The same function appears in the standard Maybe library, but with a less intuitive name: isJust.
